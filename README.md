# Financial-Advisory-Crypto-Market
As an advisor in one of the top five financial advisory firms in the world, I wanted to propose a novel approach to assembling investment portfolios that are based on cryptocurrencies. Instead of basing my proposal on only returns and volatility, I wanted to include other factors that might impact the crypto marketâ€”leading to better performance for a crypto portfolio.

I have been asked by my company to create a prototype for submitting my crypto portfolio proposal to the company board of directors.

Using clustering allowed me to visually analyze the crypto data to enhance the diversity of the portfolio based on the coin_id. Clustering the different coins into groups will show which coins that perform similarly and therefore choosing coins in different clusters to create a cyrpto portfolio along with volitility and retuns could really improve a portfolios diversity and performance.
